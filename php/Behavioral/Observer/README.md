# Observer Pattern
> Observer is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify
> multiple objects about any events that happen to the object they’re observing.

### Applicability
Use the Observer pattern in any of the following situations:
- When an abstraction has two aspects, one dependent on the other. Encapsulating these aspects in
separate objects lets you vary and reuse them independently.
- When a change to one object requires changing others, and you don’t know how many objects need to be changed.
